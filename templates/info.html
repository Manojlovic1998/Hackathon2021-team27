                    St. Patrick was Irish, surely? The short answer is no! Although historical records are unable to verify 100%, it is widely accepted that he was born in the south west of Britain circa 386 A.D. His birth name was not even Patrick but Maewyn Succat, with the name Patrick being taken later in life during his religious journey. Patrick came from a wealthy family, his father coming from a Roman family of high social standing but his upbringing was not especially religious. Much of what we do know about Patrick comes from his short autobiography Confessio.

                    In the early 5th century, Patrick was kidnapped by Irish pirates during a raid on the family estate in the village of Bannavem Taburniae. Such raids were not uncommon during this period as the Irish took advantage of the crumbling Roman Empire in Britain. They would regularly plunder animals,clothing and even young men and women to serve them. Patrick was one such man and he was taken to Ireland and sold into slavery.

                    Patrick was sold to a high priest of Druidism, a Pagan sect which held major religious influence in Ireland at the time. It is widely believed that this was in Mount Slemish in County Antrim, where he was put to work tending sheep. Patrick lived in virtual isolation during his time as a shepherd and it was during this period that he turned to Christianity for solace. Patrick had a vision of the children of pagan Ireland reaching out to him, which he took as a sign to convert Ireland to Christianity.

                    Yes, sheep have four stomachs – or rather four stomach compartments. The first is the ‘rumen’, where digestive juices and enzymes start to breakdown the food. The second is the ‘reticulum’, where juices from the chewed-up food are stored. The third is the ‘omasum’, where muscles squeeze the food to remove any remaining liquid. The fourth is the ‘abomasum’, which mixes and churns the food with more digestive juices before passing it into the intestine where nutrients are absorbed.

More than 1,500 passengers and crew perished. The ship was built at the massive Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast before sailing toSouthampton for its maiden voyage. Once constructed, the ship was the largest movable manmade object in the world at the time.

                    Following years of religious training, Patrick was eventually consecrated as a bishop in 432 A.D. He never lost sight of his vision to convert Ireland to Christianity and was sent by the Pope to spread the gospel to the non-believers in the country. There was also a small community of Christians already living in Ireland to whom Patrick was to provide support. Contrary to popular belief, St. Patrick did not actually introduce Christianity to Ireland! He was, however, instrumental in spreading the word. Legend has it that one method he used was to explain the holy trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit using the three leaves of a shamrock.

                    Have you heard of the tradition of women proposing marriage to men on the 29th February? Did you know that this has its origins with St. Patrick? Legend has it that St. Brigid of Kildare bitterly complained to St. Patrick that women had to wait far too long for men to propose. St. Patrick was said to have then decreed that women could propose on this one day in a leap year.

                    Legend has it that Patrick stood on an Irish hillside and delivered a sermon that drove the island’s serpents into the sea. Although a wonderful story, it is not the true reason why there are no wild snakes in Ireland. During the Ice Age, which ended 10,000 years ago, the climate in Ireland was too cold for reptiles such as snakes to survive. As the Ice Age ended and the ice melted, the rising seas cut off Ireland from the European mainland, which prevented snakes from colonizing the island. We’ll give Patrick the credit though!

                    Guinness is synonymous with St. Patrick’s Day and Ireland, with millions ordering a pint of ‘the black stuff’ on the 17th March. However, Guinness isn’t actually black! It is in fact a dark ruby red colour, which is derived from the roasted barley. That doesn’t stop 10 million glasses being enjoyed every day around the world. Great Britain is the largest consumer of Guinness, followed by Ireland, Nigeria, the USA and Cameroon.
