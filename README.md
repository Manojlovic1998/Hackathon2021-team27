# Pints with Paddy!

A quiz game where you answer general knowledge questions related to the story of Irelands patron Saint Patrick. 
You will be given bits of the story as you answer the questions and earn a shamrock for each correct answer. If you get them all right you might even be treated to a pint by the man himself!

Also included is a page with more info on the stories and history of Saint Patrick.

## UX

We chose the layout to focus in on the questions and answers as they are the central point of the game. We also wanted to have a lead in sentence or two 
about what part of the story the question relates to. The questions and story flow cronologically from the birth all the way through his greatest legends.

Having an info page for people to learn more meant you didn't have to go far if you were having trouble with the questions, or if you were hungry for more facts 
afterwards!

### User Stories

As a user I want to be able to answer general trivia about St Patricks day.

As a parent I want a fun way for my kids to learn more about St Patrick.

As a gamer I want a reward for completing the quiz with all right answers.

## Features Left to Implement

If we had more time we had planned to implement animations and sounds to each question. At first we tried with HTML/CSS transitions but those were not 
responsive enough and just detracted from the experience. Then we tried with Green Sock but this won't have taken too much time to learn and implement.

Instead we focused on the writing and logic to make the user experience the best it could be with a simple clean layout.
