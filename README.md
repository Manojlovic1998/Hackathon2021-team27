# Pints with Paddy!

A quiz game where you answer general knowledge questions related to the story of Irelands patron Saint Patrick. 
You will be given bits of the story as you answer the questions and earn a shamrock for each correct answer. If you get them all right you might even be treated to a pint by the man himself!

Also included is a page with more info on the stories and history of Saint Patrick.

## UX

We chose the layout to focus in on the questions and answers as they are the central point of the game. We also wanted to have a lead in sentence or two 
about what part of the story the question relates to. The questions and story flow cronologically from the birth all the way through his greatest legends.

Having an info page for people to learn more meant you didn't have to go far if you were having trouble with the questions, or if you were hungry for more facts 
afterwards!

We also made sure to include a page for anyone who ended up with more points than questions (potential cheaters!)

### User Stories

As a user I want to be able to answer general trivia about St Patricks day.

As a parent I want a fun way for my kids to learn more about St Patrick.

As a gamer I want a reward for completing the quiz with all right answers.

## Features Left to Implement

If we had more time we had planned to implement animations and sounds to each question. At first we tried with HTML/CSS transitions but those were not 
responsive enough and just detracted from the experience. Then we tried with Green Sock but this won't have taken too much time to learn and implement.

Instead we focused on the writing and logic to make the user experience the best it could be with a simple clean layout.

##Technologies Used

#### HTML

Basic coding done in HTML to display on web.

#### CSS 

CSS used to style HTML.

#### Bootstrap 

A framework of HTML, CSS, and JS libraries that help build the site in a mobile first mindframe.

#### Javascript 

For handling logic and displaying pages correctly as the game progresses.

#### JSON 

JSON is an open standard file format, and data interchange format, 
that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types.

#### Kleiki 

An open source web paiting tool we used to create all art objects for the game.

#### Slack

Commuincation tool used to message and call and share throughout the project.

## Testing

We have tested the app in several browsers, one of our testers ran into issues where special characters were not 
displaying correctly. We managed to isolate the issues to his computer and now have marked it as solved as he can view the deployed pages correctly!

We tested to ensure scores were calculating correctly and that an anti cheating page would deploy if the score was higher than it possibly would be without cheating.

## Deployment

We deployed the project to Heroku
