# Pints with Paddy!

A quiz game where you answer general knowledge questions related to the story of Irelands patron Saint Patrick. 
You will be given bits of the story as you answer the questions and earn a shamrock for each correct answer. If you get them all right you might even be treated to a pint by the man himself!

Also included is a page with more info on the stories and history of Saint Patrick.

## UX

We chose the layout to focus in on the questions and answers as they are the central point of the game. We also wanted to have a lead in sentence or two 
about what part of the story the question relates to. The questions and story flow cronologically from the birth all the way through his greatest legends.

Having an info page for people to learn more meant you didn't have to go far if you were having trouble with the questions, or if you were hungry for more facts 
afterwards!

### User Stories

As a user I want to be able to answer general trivia about St Patricks day.

As a parent I want a fun way for my kids to learn more about St Patrick.

As a gamer I want a reward for completing the quiz with all right answers.

## Features Left to Implement

If we had more time we had planned to implement animations and sounds to each question. At first we tried with HTML/CSS transitions but those were not 
responsive enough and just detracted from the experience. Then we tried with Green Sock but this won't have taken too much time to learn and implement.

Instead we focused on the writing and logic to make the user experience the best it could be with a simple clean layout.

##Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JSON, 

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
